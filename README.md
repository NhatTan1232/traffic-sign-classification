## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the [Traffic Sign Dataset - Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahemateja19bec1025/traffic-sign-dataset-classification). It contains over 6000 images of traffic signs in 57 classes.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NhatTan1232/traffic-sign-classification.git
cd traffic-sign-classification
```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it (optional):

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run steamlit:
```bash
streamlit run main.py
```
